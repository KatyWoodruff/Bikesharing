# Bikesharing

## Overview 
I have analyzed New York City bike sharing data in order to determine how to create a successful bikesharing business in Des Moines.


## Results

Below we can see that a larger amount of bikes are checked out for shorter trip durations than longer ones.

This data shows that a lorger number of men are checking out bikes, than any other gender option listed.

According to this visual, during the workweek more bikes are checked out at the beggining and end of the standard 9-5 workday.

This data continues to support that Men are checkout out nikes more frequently than other listed gender options.

We can see with this visual that there are more checkouts by subscribers than by one time customers.

The more busy sections of the city tend to have higher starting trip rates, than the further out areas.

WIth this information we are able to assertain which bikes will need more frequent reapirs, and which ones will not.

## Summary
With the given data, we can see that the greatest opportunity for profit is during commuting hours in highly dense cities. We could use additional data to determine the viability of this business model in Des Moines. I have included another visualization that can help in determining better opportunity for profit:

Here we can determine that certain times of day will have longer ride durations than others.

I also recommend visualizing start and end points with bike ID numbers to determine how subscribers are utilizing the bikeshare.
